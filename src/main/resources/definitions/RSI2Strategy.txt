Developed by Larry Connors, the 2-period RSI strategy is a mean-reversion trading strategy designed to buy or sell securities after a corrective period. The strategy is rather simple. Connors suggests looking for buying opportunities when 2-period RSI moves below 10, which is considered deeply oversold. Conversely, traders can look for short-selling opportunities when 2-period RSI moves above 90. This is a rather aggressive short-term strategy designed to participate in an ongoing trend. It is not designed to identify major tops or bottoms. Before looking at the details, note that this article is designed to educate chartists on possible strategies. We are not presenting a stand-alone trading strategy that can be used right out of the box. Instead, this article is meant to enhance strategy development and refinement.
